      <p> I haven't been to the dentist for a long time but I felt I couldn't put it off any longer. I researched by reading the reviews on this site and was amazed that 'Corner House' got such consistently high ratings. I did have to wait a few weeks for an appointment and they aren't taking any NHS patients at the moment, but even on the NHS you have to pay quite a lot - especially as I always have white fillings, so it wasn't too much of a problem. The dentist and assistant were both lovely. They immediately put me at ease and explained everything clearly and carefully. I had to have two fillings, which they did there and then. This was great as I hate the feeling leading up to the next appointment. I have been back for a scale and polish - unusually carried out by the same dentist. This again was good as by now I totally trusted them. I highly recommend this dentist.</p>

      <p> Two days ago I had the roots from a molar removed, which I was dreading, and i couldn't believe how quick and painless the whole procedure was. My dentist had removed the molar which had broken but the dentist couldn't get the roots out. I was referred to High Ash to see the dental surgeon and I was very impressed and now I am pain free. I can't thank you enough.</p>
